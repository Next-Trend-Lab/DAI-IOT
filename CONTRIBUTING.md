# Contributing to Nexttrend DAI<>IOT Integration Project

## Overview
This repository is part of the Nexttrend project, focusing on the integration of Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DAI) with Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We're investigating feasibility, challenges, and potential applications to enhance security, privacy, and autonomous decision-making in smart environments.

#### Meeting Notes and Decision Logs
- Document key discussions and decisions made during project meetings
- Maintain a decision log to track important project choices and their rationale

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code of Conduct
