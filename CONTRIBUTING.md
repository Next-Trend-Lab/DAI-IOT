# Nexttrend DAI<>IOT Integration Project

## Overview
This open-source repository is part of the Nexttrend project, focusing on the integration of Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DAI) with Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We're investigating feasibility, challenges, and potential applications to enhance security, privacy, and autonomous decision-making in smart environments.
